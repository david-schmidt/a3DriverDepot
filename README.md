# Apple /// Driver Depot

### Repository for all Apple /// drivers, buildable with `ca65`

## Idea

Be able to maintain all known Apple /// device drivers with "modern" tools (Have _you_ used the Apple Pascal Assembler?!?)

The `ca65` assembler is part of the `cc65` toolchain: [cc65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65)

# Apple /// driver for Unifile

Unifile/Duofile drivers have surfaced; this is the beginning of their disassembly and documentation.

The code for the driver (`df1.driver_code_0x2000`) was extracted from a working disk using Rob Justice's a3driverutil
project: https://github.com/robjustice/a3driverutil .
The disassembly and reassembly can be reproduced with Andy McFadden's `6502Bench` tool: https://6502bench.com/ .
